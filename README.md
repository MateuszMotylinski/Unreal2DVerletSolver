# Unreal-2D-Verlet-Solver

Custom physics simulation using Verlet integration, implemented in C++ and visualized through Unreal Engine 5. While UE5 handled rendering, all physics logic—including motion simulation and basic collision detection/resolution—was built from the ground up. This hands-on approach allowed me to explore the stability and simplicity that make Verlet integration ideal for real-time simulations.

The project was driven by my desire to better understand the inner workings of physics systems in game development. I focused on core concepts such as motion dynamics and collision handling, which are essential to many interactive applications. Implementing these systems myself not only deepened my grasp of the underlying mathematics but also introduced me to the practical challenges of optimizing for performance.

Beyond improving my physics programming skills, this project reinforced the value of building systems from scratch. Using Unreal Engine 5 for visualization let me focus on the core logic while presenting the results in an engaging, interactive environment. Overall, it was a rewarding blend of technical exploration and creative execution.
